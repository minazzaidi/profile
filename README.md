**📊 Power BI Projects**

So this a project which I did from Sales Department Data. The Data consists of Sales Target for each Sales person and Actual Sales Done for the Calendar Year 2023 and 2024. Along with that there is a table for Teams for Sales Persons.
Using the data I have creaeted basic KPI dashboard portraying how the actual and target sales comparison is based on each months, and how many months we have reached the target. 
The data can be filtered using Sales Teams. You will see a seperate Calculations table for the measures created for this particualar dashboard too. 

**Steps used to create the dashboard real quick**

Step 1: Cleaning the data:

For Sales actual and Sales Target Table : Promote row as headers > Unpivot all columns except Sales person for the actual and sales sheet > Fixing the data types. 

For calendar table: Add month name, month, year columns > Fix data type

Step 2: Data Modelling

There are 2 fact tables in this data (Sales Actual and Sales Target) and 2 dimension Tables (Calendar and People) 

Dimension tables are connected to fact tables with one to many relationship.

Step 3: Calculations

I created a calculations table to calculate all the KPIs which are mentioned in the dashboard.

Step 4: Visualizations

I created different visuals related to the data which provides valuable insights. There is also a win-loss chart which you might like.(PS. Thats my favorite part of the dashboard)

Download the pbix file attached and take a look at the dashboard.
